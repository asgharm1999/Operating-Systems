1. Run Terminal on Linux or get WSL from Windows Store and download Ubuntu
2. Install gcc
3. Navigate to the directory of downloaded files (if using WSL note: you must start command with /mnt/c/Users/... where c is the drive name)

These are the following commands for the problems:

Q1: 

gcc HW0Q1.c -o HW0Q1
./HW0Q1 64

Q2:

gcc HW0Q2.c -o HW0Q2
./HW0Q2 64

Q3:

gcc HW0Q3.c -o HW0Q3 -lpthread
./HW0Q3 90 81 78 95 79 72 85 

Q4:

gcc HW0Q4.c -o HW0Q4 -lpthread
./HW0Q4 5

Feel free to change the numbers after the ./HW0Qx and play around with it
